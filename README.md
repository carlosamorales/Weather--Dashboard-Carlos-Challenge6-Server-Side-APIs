## Description


### What:
The weather dashboard is a web application with form inputs that allow users to search for cities. Upon searching for a city, the dashboard presents the user with both current and future weather conditions for that city. Additionally, the searched city is added to the search history for reference. The current weather conditions include the city name, date, weather condition icon, temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The future weather conditions display a 5-day forecast with the date, weather condition icon, temperature, wind speed, and humidity.

### Why:
The purpose of the weather dashboard is to provide users with comprehensive and easily accessible weather information for cities of interest. By offering both current and future weather conditions, along with a search history feature, the dashboard aims to enhance user experience and enable users to make informed decisions based on weather forecasts.

### How:
The weather dashboard achieves its functionality by utilizing form inputs for city search and integrating with a weather API to fetch weather data for the specified cities. The dashboard dynamically updates its content to display current and future weather conditions in a visually appealing format. Additionally, it utilizes event listeners to respond to user interactions, such as clicking on a city in the search history, and retrieves and displays relevant weather information accordingly. Overall, the dashboard combines user-friendly design with real-time data retrieval to fulfill its purpose effectively.
